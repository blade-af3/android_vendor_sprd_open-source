/*
 * MOZ_STATIC_ASSERT may be used to assert a condition *at compile time* in C.
 * In C++11, static_assert is provided by the compiler to the same effect.
 * This can be useful when you make certain assumptions about what must hold for
 * optimal, or even correct, behavior.  For example, you might assert that the
 * size of a struct is a multiple of the target architecture's word size:
 *
 *   struct S { ... };
 *   // C
 *   MOZ_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(S) % sizeof(size_t) == 0,
 *                     "S should be a multiple of word size for efficiency");
 *   // C++11
 *   static_assert(sizeof(S) % sizeof(size_t) == 0,
 *                 "S should be a multiple of word size for efficiency");
 *
 * This macro can be used in any location where both an extern declaration and a
 * typedef could be used.
